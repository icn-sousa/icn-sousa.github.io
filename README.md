# Personal Website Repository

This repository contains the code used to generate my personal website (in Portuguese): [icn-sousa.github.io/](https://icn-sousa.github.io/)

I utilized [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to built the website. If you're interested in creating a website with Quarto, check out the official [documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

The deployment process was made through [GitHub Pages](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).

For a comprehensive guide on constructing and tailoring a website, I highly recommend this [tutorial](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/#fa-people-carry-box-titletwo-people-lift-a-large-box-together-acknowledgements). It proved immensely helpful in developing and customizing my website.
